# MeerKAT_Source_Matching
This repository has the code I'm using for MeerKAT absolute astrometry and source matching to catalogues from other instruments at different wavelengths.

For now, it has the code I used to correct the astrometry and determine the astrometry uncertainties using ATPMN sources that are within the MeerKAT field of view of our sources.
